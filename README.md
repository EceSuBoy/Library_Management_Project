# Library Management System Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The **Library Management System** is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline and manage various library operations such as managing books, book categories, users, members, and announcements. Through this system, users can register via the **Register** page and are redirected to the panel upon successful registration. 

There are three types of users in the system:
- **Admin**
- **Moderator**
- **Regular User**

While Admins and Moderators have access to the full system, Regular Users are limited to a subset of functionalities.

With this management panel, you can issue and return books, monitor user activities, track book transactions, and observe book registration logs in the database. For instance, when a user logs into the system, a log entry like "User XXX has logged in" is added to the user activity records.

## ðŸ”„ Stock Management via Triggers

A **Trigger** structure has been used to automatically manage book stock levels. When a book is borrowed, the stock decreases; when it is returned, the stock updates accordingly â€” all managed automatically at the database level.
